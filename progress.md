# PhonoPlay Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Setup & Core Infrastructure (Completed: 50%)

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
   - Created basic folder structure
   - Added essential dependencies
   - Set up Supabase client configuration
   - Created TypeScript types for word entries
   - Implemented word utility functions
   - Added application configuration

### In Progress:
- Setting up Supabase authentication
- Creating database schema
- Implementing API routes

### Next Steps:
1. Complete Supabase setup
2. Create authentication pages
3. Implement practice session management
4. Build the word selection interface
5. Create the practice screen components

### What We Did
- Added detailed logging to the LLM API route for model, prompt, raw response, and Supabase results.
- Updated the prompt to strictly require a comma-separated list of words, with no extra text or formatting.
- Tested with different models and confirmed that using an OpenAI model (like gpt-3.5-turbo) with the improved prompt produces the correct output.
- Verified that the UI now displays matching words as expected.

### Problems Encountered and Solutions
- Problem: LLMs (like Gemma) did not follow prompt, causing parsing to fail.
- Solution: Switched to OpenAI model and improved prompt strictness for reliable parsing.
- Problem: Could not append to progress.md due to tool limitation.
- Solution: Provided a summary here for manual copy-paste.

### What We Learned
- Prompt engineering is critical for reliable LLM output.
- Always test with strict prompts and fallback to robust models for best results.
- Logging every step in the API is invaluable for debugging and learning.
