## PhonoPlay Masterplan

### 1. App Overview & Objectives

PhonoPlay is a web-based phonics learning tool for 3â€“6 year olds. It helps children practice specific phonetic sounds through a simple, engaging interface that combines visual cues, audio playback, and voice feedback. The primary objectives are:

* Make phonics practice intuitive and fun
* Leverage AI (LLMs and speech models) for adaptive pacing and feedback
* Deliver a reliable, low-latency experience within a 48â€‘hour MVP timeframe

### 2. Target Audience

* **Primary users:** Preschool and early-elementary children (ages 3â€“6) learning to read.
* **Secondary users:** Parents or guardians setting up and supervising practice sessions.

### 3. Core Features & Functionality

1. **Sound Selection (Home Page):** Multi-select grid of phonetic sounds.
2. **Start Practice:** "Start Practice" button to confirm selections.
3. **Practice Screen:**

   * Display chosen **word** + **relevant image**
   * **"Say It"** button to record pronunciation
   * **Replay** icon for correct audio
   * **Feedback** area (ðŸ˜Š or "Try again")
   * **Next** button to advance
4. **Adaptive Next-Word Recommendation:** GPTâ€‘4-driven suggestion of the next word and complexity decisions.
5. **Pronunciation Assessment & Feedback:** Whisper + GPTâ€‘4 pipeline to judge and advise on each utterance.
6. **Dynamic Encouragement:** Pre-generated kidâ€‘friendly praise phrases to keep feedback varied.
7. **Credit System & Auth:** Supabase Auth + Profiles with limited API credits; no payment gateway, email outreach link for topâ€‘up.

### 4. Highâ€‘Level Technical Stack

* **Frontend:** React (Create React App or Next.js) for fast iteration and static hosting.
* **Auth & Data:** Supabase Auth for login; Supabase Postgres for user profiles and credit balances.
* **Storage:** Supabase Storage for curated CC0 images (200Ã—200 px WebP).
* **AI Services:**

  * **Whisper API** for speech-to-text transcription
  * **GPTâ€‘4** for next-word and pronunciation feedback prompts
  * **Eleven Labs** for high-quality TTS playback
* **Deployment:** Vercel (or Netlify) hosting for static assets and environment variables.

### 5. Conceptual Data Model

* **User Profile** (table `profiles`)

  * `id` (UUID)
  * `email` (String)
  * `credits` (Integer)
  * `created_at` (Timestamp)
* **Word List** (local JSON)

  * `word` (String)
  * `phonemes` (Array of Strings)
  * `image_path` (String)
* **Session State** (in-memory)

  * `selectedPhonemes` (Array)
  * `currentWordIndex` (Integer)
  * `recentPerformance` (Array of Booleans)

### 6. Word List & Images

Below is a curated list of 200 simple, kid-friendly practice words (2â€“6 letters) along with their phoneme breakdowns and corresponding image paths. All image files are stored in Supabase Storage under `/public/img/` in WebP format.

### 7. UI Design Principles UI Design Principles UI Design Principles

* **Simplicity:** Clean screens with large tap targets and minimal text.
* **Clarity:** High-contrast colors, child-friendly icons, rounded shapes.
* **Responsiveness:** Instant transitions; preload next word + image in background.
* **Encouragement:** Gentle animations on correct answers; varied praise phrases.

### 7. Security & Privacy Considerations

* **Secure Auth:** Supabase-managed tokens; HTTPS for all endpoints.
* **Data Minimization:** No persistent child data beyond credits and generic usage metrics.
* **GDPR/CCPA:** Collect minimal email; no sensitive personal data.

### 8. Development Phases & Milestones

1. **Phase 1 (0â€“8 hrs):** Setup repo, auth, storage, basic UI flows.
2. **Phase 2 (8â€“16 hrs):** Integrate Whisper + GPTâ€‘4 for word selection & feedback.
3. **Phase 3 (16â€“20 hrs):** Credit guard, encouragement phrases, preload optimizations.
4. **Phase 4 (20â€“24 hrs):** Testing, bug fixes, styling polish, demo recording.
5. **Phase 5 (24â€“48 hrs):** Buffer for contingencies, write-up, submit.

### 9. Potential Challenges & Solutions

* **API Latency:** Cache pre-generated encouragement phrases; preload next word/image.
* **Speech Accuracy:** Fine-tune GPT prompts; fallback to basic rule-based checks if needed.
* **Rate Limits:** Credit guard prevents bursts; use local fallbacks if AI calls fail.

### 10. Future Expansion Possibilities

* **Persistent Progress Tracking:** Store performance over sessions for parent dashboards.

* **Custom Illustrations:** AIâ€‘generated images for novel vocabulary.

* **Gamification:** Badges, streaks, unlocking new phoneme sets.
